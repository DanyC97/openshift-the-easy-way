# Understanding operators

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes
application.  A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed
on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs.

## Managing the platform

Kubernetes does a great job managing a containerized application through
powerful, declarative automation primitives.

OpenShift provides a `ClusterVersionOperator` that manages a set of operators to
install, update, and lifecycle Kubernetes itself.  These operators allow us to
manage the core control plane components as a Kubernetes native application. The
`ClusterVersionOperator` manages a minimal set of components required to bring
up an OpenShift service.

## Managing applications on the platform

Applications that run on the platform have the same install, update, and
lifecycle managment problems as the control plane itself.  OpenShift provides
the `Operator Lifecycle Manager` component to enable administrators to deploy
optional parts of the OpenShift distribution.  In addition, users can package
and add their own components to `Operator Lifecycle Manager` for their own
function. If the component is provided by Red Hat, a partner, or the end-user
themselves, function delivered via `Operator Lifecycle Manager` have the
operational benefits it provides to managing lifecycle of operators.
