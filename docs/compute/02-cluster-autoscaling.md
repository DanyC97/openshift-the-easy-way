# Cluster Autoscaling

OpenShift ships an operator that can manage deployment of the Cluster Autoscaler
component.

The operator is installed by default and visible here:

```sh
oc get deployments -n openshift-cluster-api cluster-autoscaler-operator
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-autoscaler-operator   1         1         1            1           1h
```

The operator watches for `ClusterAutoscaler` resources to know how to deploy the
autoscaler.

Let's deploy and configure an autoscaler for our cluster.

Here is a sample configuration [file](../assets/cluster-autoscaler.yaml) for a
`ClusterAutoscaler` object.

By editing the cluster autoscaler operator, users are able to cap growth of the
cluster.  This configuration caps the cluster from scaling beyond 24 nodes, 128
cores, and 256Gi of memory.

```sh
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/cluster-autoscaler-operator/master/examples/clusterautoscaler.yaml
```

Let's verify the autoscaler is deployed by the operator:

```sh
oc get clusterautoscaler
NAME      AGE
default   2m
oc get deployments -n openshift-cluster-api
NAME                             DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-autoscaler-default       1         1         1            0           3m
```

Let's deploy a job to demonstrate autoscaling.
